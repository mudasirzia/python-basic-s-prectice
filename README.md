# 🐍 Python Learning Tasks – by Mudasir Zia

Hello! I'm **Mudasir Zia**, a student of **FSc (Computer Science)**.  
This repository contains my personal Python practice tasks and mini-projects.

## 📌 About These Tasks

- These tasks are **not for absolute beginners**, but also **not fully advanced**.
- They cover **practical problems**, basic concepts, and **mini projects**.
- No deep OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is used yet — mainly focused on logic building and practice.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I’m learning Python step by step, and I believe **we learn better together**.

💬 **So feel free to:**
- Use my code as learning material  
- Ask questions or discuss logic  
- Suggest improvements  
- Learn with me by chatting and sharing ideas

## 🤝 Let’s Learn Together

If you're also a beginner or intermediate Python learner, you're welcome here.  
We can **help each other** grow by learning through conversation and practice.

> 🔁 Learning is a journey. Let's make it fun and useful — together! 🚀
